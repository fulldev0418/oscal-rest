  title: OSCAL REST
  description: |
    A draft proposal from [Easy Dynamics](https://www.easydynamics.com) of a REST API specification for exchanging
    [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/) content between tool instances and organizations.

    Standardized data models like OSCAL lay the groundwork for interoperability of systems, and an ecosystem of
    meaningful integrations can be brought to life through a standardized REST API.  Such an API will likely see the most
    success across various vendors and projects when maintained by a standards body or community, and we're looking
    to get that conversation started with this effort.

        Adds a new assessment plan.         The client must include the `Content-type` HTML header and set it to one of the following:
         - `application/json` when sending an OSCAL file in JSON format;
         - `application/xml` when sending an OSCAL file in XML format; or

OSCAL content sent to the server in any one of the three formats _must_ be made available in all three formats for the relevant GET method/endpoint combinations.

      summary: Creates a snapshot of the file in its current state.
      description: |
        Creates a snapshot of the file in its current state. The implementation _must_ assign and track a unique identifier for the snapshot, by which the snapshot may be referenced later. The implementation _must_ add the `snapshot-created` property to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows:

         - **Snapshot Created** Property [**Exactly 1 (REQUIRED)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-created"`
           - `"value" : "2024-03-24T16:10:42.251Z"` (date-time-with-timezone)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         The implementation _may_ add a `snapshot-description` property, as well as `snapshot-label` and `snapshot-type` properties to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows when included in the payload from the client:

         - **Snapshot Description** Property [**0 or 1 (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-description"`
           - `"value" : "na"` (`value` is required by OSCAL, but not needed for this property. It can include any string.)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`
           - `"remarks" : "An optional snapshot description."` (markup-multiline)

         - **Snapshot Label** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-label"`
           - `"value" : "v1.2.3"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         - **Snapshot Type** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-type"`
           - `"value" : "published"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         All of the above properties are OSCAL extensions and must include the namespace (`ns`) information.

        Replaces the profile represented by the profile ID.         The client must include the `Content-type` HTML header and set it to one of the following:
         - `application/json` when sending an OSCAL file in JSON format;
         - `application/xml` when sending an OSCAL file in XML format; or
         - `application/yaml` when sending an OSCAL file in YAML format.         The implementation _must_ accept all three OSCAL formats. OSCAL content sent to the server in any one of the three formats _must_ be made available in all three formats for the relevant GET method/endpoint combinations.

      description: |
        Creates a snapshot of the file in its current state. The implementation _must_ assign and track a unique identifier for the snapshot, by which the snapshot may be referenced later. The implementation _must_ add the `snapshot-created` property to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows:

         - **Snapshot Created** Property [**Exactly 1 (REQUIRED)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-created"`
           - `"value" : "2024-03-24T16:10:42.251Z"` (date-time-with-timezone)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         The implementation _may_ add a `snapshot-description` property, as well as `snapshot-label` and `snapshot-type` properties to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows when included in the payload from the client:

         - **Snapshot Description** Property [**0 or 1 (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-description"`
           - `"value" : "na"` (`value` is required by OSCAL, but not needed for this property. It can include any string.)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`
           - `"remarks" : "An optional snapshot description."` (markup-multiline)

         - **Snapshot Label** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-label"`
           - `"value" : "v1.2.3"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         - **Snapshot Type** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-type"`
           - `"value" : "published"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         All of the above properties are OSCAL extensions and must include the namespace (`ns`) information.

           - `"name" : "snapshot-description"`
           - `"value" : "na"` (`value` is required by OSCAL, but not needed for this property. It can include any string.)

      description: |
        Creates a snapshot of the file in its current state. The implementation _must_ assign and track a unique identifier for the snapshot, by which the snapshot may be referenced later. The implementation _must_ add the `snapshot-created` property to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows:

         - **Snapshot Created** Property [**Exactly 1 (REQUIRED)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-created"`
           - `"value" : "2024-03-24T16:10:42.251Z"` (date-time-with-timezone)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         The implementation _may_ add a `snapshot-description` property, as well as `snapshot-label` and `snapshot-type` properties to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows when included in the payload from the client:

         - **Snapshot Description** Property [**0 or 1 (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-description"`
           - `"value" : "na"` (`value` is required by OSCAL, but not needed for this property. It can include any string.)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`
           - `"remarks" : "An optional snapshot description."` (markup-multiline)

         - **Snapshot Label** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-label"`

      description: |
        Replaces the catalog represented by the catalog ID.         The client must include the `Content-type` HTML header and set it to one of the following:
         - `application/json` when sending an OSCAL file in JSON format;
         - `application/xml` when sending an OSCAL file in XML format; or
         - `application/yaml` when sending an OSCAL file in YAML format.         The implementation _must_ accept all three OSCAL formats. OSCAL content sent to the server in any one of the three formats _must_ be made available in all three formats for the relevant GET method/endpoint combinations.

        Creates a snapshot of the file in its current state. The implementation _must_ assign and track a unique identifier for the snapshot, by which the snapshot may be referenced later. The implementation _must_ add the `snapshot-created` property to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows:

         - **Snapshot Created** Property [**Exactly 1 (REQUIRED)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-created"`
           - `"value" : "2024-03-24T16:10:42.251Z"` (date-time-with-timezone)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         The implementation _may_ add a `snapshot-description` property, as well as `snapshot-label` and `snapshot-type` properties to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows when included in the payload from the client:

         - **Snapshot Description** Property [**0 or 1 (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-description"`
           - `"value" : "na"` (`value` is required by OSCAL, but not needed for this property. It can include any string.)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`
           - `"remarks" : "An optional snapshot description."` (markup-multiline)

         - **Snapshot Label** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-label"`
           - `"value" : "v1.2.3"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

           - `"value" : "published"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         All of the above properties are OSCAL extensions and must include the namespace (`ns`) information.

        Replaces the plan of action and milestones represented by the plan of action and milestones ID.         The client must include the `Content-type` HTML header and set it to one of the following:
         - `application/json` when sending an OSCAL file in JSON format;
         - `application/xml` when sending an OSCAL file in XML format; or
         - `application/yaml` when sending an OSCAL file in YAML format.         The implementation _must_ accept all three OSCAL formats. OSCAL content sent to the server in any one of the three formats _must_ be made available in all three formats for the relevant GET method/endpoint combinations.

        Creates a snapshot of the file in its current state. The implementation _must_ assign and track a unique identifier for the snapshot, by which the snapshot may be referenced later. The implementation _must_ add the `snapshot-created` property to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows:

         - **Snapshot Created** Property [**Exactly 1 (REQUIRED)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-created"`
           - `"value" : "2024-03-24T16:10:42.251Z"` (date-time-with-timezone)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         The implementation _may_ add a `snapshot-description` property, as well as `snapshot-label` and `snapshot-type` properties to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows when included in the payload from the client:

         - **Snapshot Description** Property [**0 or 1 (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-description"`
           - `"value" : "na"` (`value` is required by OSCAL, but not needed for this property. It can include any string.)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`
           - `"remarks" : "An optional snapshot description."` (markup-multiline)

         - **Snapshot Label** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-label"`
           - `"value" : "v1.2.3"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         - **Snapshot Type** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-type"`
           - `"value" : "published"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         All of the above properties are OSCAL extensions and must include the namespace (`ns`) information.

      description: |
        Creates a snapshot of the file in its current state. The implementation _must_ assign and track a unique identifier for the snapshot, by which the snapshot may be referenced later. The implementation _must_ add the `snapshot-created` property to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows:

         - **Snapshot Created** Property [**Exactly 1 (REQUIRED)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-created"`
           - `"value" : "2024-03-24T16:10:42.251Z"` (date-time-with-timezone)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         The implementation _may_ add a `snapshot-description` property, as well as `snapshot-label` and `snapshot-type` properties to the OSCAL document's `metadata` as follows when included in the payload from the client:

         - **Snapshot Description** Property [**0 or 1 (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-description"`
           - `"value" : "na"` (`value` is required by OSCAL, but not needed for this property. It can include any string.)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`
           - `"remarks" : "An optional snapshot description."` (markup-multiline)

         - **Snapshot Label** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-label"`
           - `"value" : "v1.2.3"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         - **Snapshot Type** Property [**0 or more (OPTIONAL)**]:
           - `"name" : "snapshot-type"`
           - `"value" : "published"` (token)
           - `"ns" : "http://oscal.io/ns/oscal/1.0.0"`

         All of the above properties are OSCAL extensions and must include the namespace (`ns`) information.
